This is a Java program that finds the shortest path bewteen two user-indicated coordinates on an NxN graph.
This program uses Dijkstra's Single-Source Shortest Path algorithm, and the space graph class which I designed.
Run this program by running the Run.java file

TODO:
change graph printing from string to stringbuilder to decrease runtime
